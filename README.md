# Notes
* What is working?
  * The program is believed to be working as intended.
* What are the limitations of the program?
  * Limited by my imagination
* What design decisions did you make?
  * The base class is abstract with abstract methods that gets overridden by the derived classes
  * An interface keyword could have been used I believe but I did not know how to do that
